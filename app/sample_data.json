        "text": "Global finance is getting shaky again. Traditional tools are losing their punch, and now the US is openly talking about a move straight out of the history books \u2014 **gold monetization**.\n\nHere\u2019s the play:\n\n* The US holds **261.5M ounces of gold**, officially valued at $42/oz (1973 prices \ud83e\udd2f).\n* Market price today: **$3,300+/oz**.\n* If revalued, Treasury could issue gold certificates at the new price to the Fed, instantly crediting **\\~$900B** without selling a single bar.\n* No new debt, just\u2026 magic money backed by gold.\n\nIt\u2019s been done before:\n\n* **1933:** FDR confiscated gold, raised price by 69%, pumped cash into the economy.\n* **1971\u201373:** Nixon ended gold-dollar convertibility, Treasury revalued, pocketed \\~$800M without selling gold.\n\nWhy now?\n\n* Fed\u2019s own memo (Aug 1) points to other countries doing it \u2014 Germany, Italy, Lebanon, South Africa.\n* Analysts like Luke Gromen say revaluing to **$20K/oz** could free up **$5T**, slashing US debt-to-GDP from 122% \u2192 \\~70%.\n* Trump\u2019s Treasury officials are hinting it\u2019s \u201con the table.\u201d\n\nThe crypto twist:\n\n* Last year, Sen. Cynthia Lummis floated using revalued gold profits to **buy Bitcoin** for a US strategic reserve \u2014 \u201cbudget-neutral.\u201d\n* Trump\u2019s crypto advisor called it \u201cthe best way\u201d to get BTC without taxing Americans.\n\nWhy this matters for Bitcoin:\n\n1. If fiat confidence drops, capital looks for hard assets \u2014 gold *and* BTC.\n2. State-level BTC accumulation could push it into a **reserve asset class**.\n3. But\u2026 big players = big control risks: more regulation, less freedom, political capture.\n\nBottom line:  \nGold monetization might be sold as a \u201csmart debt fix,\u201d but it\u2019s still stealth money printing. If it happens, we could see:\n\n* **Short-term:** BTC moon fuel \ud83d\ude80\n* **Long-term:** A fight for BTC\u2019s soul \u2014 decentralized freedom vs. state-controlled asset.",

        "text": "Today I took profits for the first time ever. I\u2019ve rode the coaster up and down since 2016 always holding and today I pulled the trigger and sold off 10% of my holdings. \n\nIt felt incredible once the deposit hit my bank account and I just want to encourage people to do the same. If you are struggling with the mindset of \u201cit\u2019ll be more in a year\u201d I justified it with the fact that I can get hit by a car tomorrow and never see it. \n\nI sold off and felt like a huge winner locking in a large profit relative to what I invested especially when the mother in law (financial advisor) used to give me major shit about Crypto and then recently started asking my advice since she has clients asking about it.\n\nSo it\u2019s a PSA - if you\u2019re struggling to justify taking profits, just take the plunge and enjoy it. If you been here for a few cycles you understand the dread of not knowing if prices will ever rebound. \n\nIn the words of Kevin Malone, it was just nice to win one ",

Then still offline I lasered them onto washers.  I obviously won\u2019t laser all 96 but they are all in the job in case someone gets a log from my laser (like if it phones home).\n\nThis results in about 145 bits of entropy.  So even if someone knew the 96 words, it would be pretty darn hard to do anything with them.\n\n\n\n",
